# Gatsby Template

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) website template with sane defaults and using [Linaria](https://linaria.now.sh/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## How to use

There are multiple ways to use this template:

1) Create a repo right in GitHub using the 'Use this template' button.

2) Download the repo as a '.zip' and work straight from there

3) Use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) which simplifies step 2.


## Additional Steps

This repo assumes / I suggest that you'll wanna set up the following tools as well:

* [Dependabot](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for automated dependency updates
* [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com/) for code quality checks
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting, build, functions, all that stuff
